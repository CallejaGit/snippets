# snippets

This is my personal snippets, works with snipmate.


**NTS**
* Make sure you have snipmate plugin working for vim
* Snippets file is located inside a `foo/snippets` directory, where `foo` is a path listed in your `runtimepath`. 
  In general, setup should be in`cd ~/.vim/snippets` directory. (See `:help 'rtp'` & `:help $VIMRUNTIME` for more info)
