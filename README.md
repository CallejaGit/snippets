# snippets

This is my personal snippets, specifically used by snipmate. Generates text by a `text` followed the tab key. 

### Adding snippets 

* Make sure you have snipmate plugin working for vim
* Snippets file is located inside a `foo/snippets` directory, where `foo` is a path listed in your `runtimepath`. 
  In general, setup should be in`cd ~/.vim/snippets` directory. (See `:help 'rtp'` & `:help $VIMRUNTIME` for more info)
